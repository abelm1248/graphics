In this project I implemented the rect(), triangle(), arc(), quad(), line(), and bezier() functions to make a bacon cheeseburger. In particular, the bezier() function was used to create the top bun in order to more realistically portray one. This burger was inspired by one of my favorite menu items at Whataburger, so I put it in front of an orange and white background to pay homage. In terms of stroke weights I used noStroke(), one, two, and three. Lastly, I used a total of ten colors which were stored with descriptive variable names.
